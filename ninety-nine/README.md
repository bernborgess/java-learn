# 99 Java Problems :coffee:

## Loading the code
- We can use the Java Shell for loading the code, in a command line just run:
```bash
$> $JAVA_HOME/bin/jshell
```
- Then inside the repl, open the desired file:
```bash
jshell> /open lesson1.java
```
- Check the functions were loaded with `/methods`:
```bash
jshell> /methods
```
